# Your First Lab

On Ironboard, labs are exercises you have to complete.

This will be seen in ironboard.

The goal of this lab is to practice the workflow to complete a lab and to see if you can make a new file or directory using terminal.

To complete this lab you will have to:

1. Fork the lab via github.
2. Clone your fork.
3. Create a new file.
4. Commit that file.
5. Push that commit to your fork.
6. Open a Pull Request for your fork.

## Forking from Github

Forking is a feature of github that creates a copy of a repository on your account. When you solve a lab, you'll be coding the solution not on the deployed copy of the lab that everyone has access too, but rather, on your copy, your fork.

### How to Fork

1. Click on the Fork Button

2. Fork it to your personal github account.

3. Make sure you are on your fork of the lab.

## Cloning from Github

Cloning means bringing down a copy of a git repository from a remote source (like Github). It is creating another copy of a repository on your computer and allowing your local copy to communicate and update the copy on github.

### How to Clone

1. Copy your Clone URL, it should start with https://

2. From your terminal, from your home directory (you can `cd ~` to quickly jump there), type in: `git clone` and then paste the clone address you copied in step 1.

3. Enter in your github credentials.

_Note: If you have 2-factor-authentication on github turned on this won't work. Turn it off from your [settings](https://github.com/settings/security)_

4. Your clone should now exist in a new directory named after the lab.

5. cd into the lab directory so you can get to work!

## Solving this Lab

Now that you have forked and cloned your fork, your goal is simple. Just create a new file within this lab.

1. You should be cd'd into this lab's directory. Confirm that your working directory in terminal is this lab: `pwd`

You should see something like: `/Users/avi/first-lab`

2. Simply create a file. It doesn't matter what you call it.

`touch my-new-file.txt`

![1](http://flatiron-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/ironboard/ironboard-tutorial/2-solving-the-lab.png)

3. Add it to the repo, staging it for commit.

`git add my-new-file.txt`

![1](http://flatiron-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/ironboard/ironboard-tutorial/3-solving-the-lab.png)

4. Confirm that the file is staged for commit with `git status`

![1](http://flatiron-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/ironboard/ironboard-tutorial/4-solving-the-lab.png)

5. Commit the file.

`git commit -am "My first commit"`

![1](http://flatiron-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/ironboard/ironboard-tutorial/5-solving-the-lab.png)


6. Push that to your fork, up to github.

`git push origin master`

![1](http://flatiron-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/ironboard/ironboard-tutorial/6-solving-the-lab.png)


7. Go to github and confirm the push.

## Opening a Pull Request

Open the lab in github (the end of step 7 above).

1. Click on the branch comparison icon from the repository home.
